# Devina
A moderation bot for the popular VOIP and chat service Discord.

Currently a work-in-progress, Devina makes use of the Discord API coupled with Python to create a moderation bot that can be implemented in Discord servers.

Please refer to Discord's API (https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro), or their help section (https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us) for assistance with implementing or modifying my code.
